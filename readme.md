This project will have multiple stages:

-create a working compendium of the devils in the SMT series (including the
original games, the mainline SMT games, Last Bible, Devil Summoner, the Persona
series, and Devil Survivor line) that:
1) [is] filterable by the game the devil shows up, its mythologic
origin,
stats/skills, and affinity assigned in each specific game (ex many
"foul" devils are later categorized as "death" affinity in subsequent
games - the handheld games have affinities such as "femme" not present
in other other entries to the series).
2) collects art from all/most of the series, including spin off
anime/manga entries, allowing users to toggle whichever version they prefer
3) collects compendium data for all demons from all games - end goal is
JPN and PAL (where applicable).
4) allows users to fuse (フージョン) demons, giving result(s) from all
applicable games (this will be tricky, as some demons do not appear in
other entries); also give users static tables and explain fusion mechanics
and their differences between games.
5) VERY PENDING - allow for community submission for compendium
entries/stats/etc? Include compendium entries for other localizations?
Include very specific dialogue given by demons in their negotiations?
6) THE DREAM (ULTIMATE PENDING) - mock demon negotiation using dialogue
options from all games where applicable, with toggleable statuses (demons
with "sexy voice" or "intimidate" etc). Nice to give people raw data of
chances of negotiation success as well - unsure if this is possible without
cracking the games?
