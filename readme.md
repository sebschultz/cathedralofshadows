This project will have multiple stages:

-create a working compendium of the devils in the SMT series that:
1) [is] filterable by the game the devil shows up, its mythologic 
origin, 
stats/skills, and affinity assigned in each specific game (ex many 
"foul" devils are later categorized as "death" affinity in subsequent 
games - the handheld games have affinities such as "femme" not present 
in other other entries to the series).
2) collects art from all/most of the series, including spin off 
anime/manga entries, allowing users to toggle whichever version they prefer
3) collects compendium data for all demons from all games - end goal is 
JPN and ENG.
4) allows users to fuse (フージョン) demons, giving result(s) from all 
applicable games (this will be tricky, as some demons do not appear in 
other entries); also give users static tables and explain fusion mechanics 
and their differences between games.
5) VERY PENDING - allow for community submission for compendium 
entries/stats/etc? Include compendium entries for other localizations? 
Include very specific dialogue given by demons in their negotiations?
6) THE DREAM (ULTIMATE PENDING) - mock demon negotiation using dialogue 
options from all games where applicable, with toggleable statuses (demons 
with "sexy voice" or "intimidate" etc). Nice to give people raw data of 
chances of negotiation success as well - unsure if this is possible without 
cracking the games?
